Finding a safe and reliable place to go for an outing as a woman travelling on her own or with other female companions is a difficult task. Usually, women resort to word of mouth reviews of destinations and rely on their friends and family to share their prior experiences. What was lacking was a centralized web-based tool which could be accessed as a reference point for women looking for a safe outing destination. 

Using anonymous, community reviews based on metrics such as safety, maintenance, family-friendliness etc, sistersInSafar aims to help Pakistani women venture out more confidently.
