For the average Pakistani woman, planning and carrying out something as simple as a casual meeting with friends is a very involved task. Picking any random destination and choosing any random mode of conveyance usually is not an option because of a multitude of safety concerns. Trying their best to make sure they don't go anywhere unnsafe, women resort to word-of-mouth reviews of places and rely on their friends and family to share their prior experiences. What was lacking was a centralized web-based tool which could be accessed as a reliable reference point for women looking for a safe place to hang out, and using a safe mode of transportation to get there. 

Using anonymous, community reviews based on metrics such as safety, maintenance, family-friendliness etc, sistersInSafar aims to help Pakistani women venture outside more confidently.
